# Habiscipline

A local-first habit manager


## Insights

* A habit manager should get out of your way as quickly as possible.
  To achieve this, it can make assumptions about what happened while you were not using it.
* Corollary to this: A closed-world system should be avoided.
  There is a big distinction between "no data" and "no engagement".
* When building a positive habit, like flossing, every engagement should give you a dopamine hit.
  When you haven't entered that you engaged in the positive habit, it can be assumed that you haven't engaged with it either. (If you have entered somehabit on a later date.)
* When building a negative habit, like quitting smoking, the topic should not be brought any more than strictly necessary. (If you have entered somehabit on a later date.)
  When you haven't entered that you did not engage, it can be assumed that you haven't engaged.
* Not every negative habit needs to be radical.
  Setting a goal like "Fewer than X grams of sugar per month" will be more feasible than "No sugar, ever".
* Positive habits can be dangerous when overdone.
  Setting a goal like "Go on three runs per week" may lead to an unhealthy amount of running like "every day" if the wrong incentives are put in place.
